Problem description: 
You are in a mall, and try to send a message via Bluetooth to a friend from your smartphone. A smartphone can connect to another one nearby via Bluetooth if the distance between them is ≤ D, the transmission threshold. Write a program to determine whether a communication path can be formed from your smartphone to your friend's via zero or more intermediate smartphones so that your message can be successfully transmitted or not.


Input specification: 
The first line consists of two positive integers N (≤ 10) and D (≤ 10); 

N is the number of smartphones in the mall, 
D is the transmission threshold. 
The next N lines are the X-Y coordinates of the locations of the N smartphones (visualize the mall as a 2D plane), of which the first one is your phone's, and the last one your friend's.
Output specification: 
The (lower-case) character “y” if there is a connected path from your phone to your friend's, or “n” if there is not.
